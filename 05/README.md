### Animate 100,000 points with regl

Blog to follow eventually... There's also a cool way to do this with textures that I will create one day, but hopefully this gives you an idea of how to play around with particles in regl. Code is similar to [my canvas example](https://bl.ocks.org/pbeshai/65420c8d722cdbb0600b276c3adcc6e8).
